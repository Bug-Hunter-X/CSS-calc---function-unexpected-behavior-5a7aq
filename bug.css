The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations, but it can lead to unexpected results if the units are inconsistent or if the browser doesn't support the calculation. For example, `width: calc(100% - 10px);` might not work as expected if the parent element doesn't have a defined width.  Another common mistake is using `calc()` with properties that don't support it, like `font-size`.
